# Project Steps: Automated Image Resizer with AWS Lambda & S3  

## üöÄ Project Overview  
A fully serverless solution to automatically resize images upon upload to an S3 bucket using AWS Lambda. This ensures optimized storage, faster load times, and seamless image processing for applications and websites.  

## üåü Key Features of the Project  
- **Automatic Image Resizing**: Lambda function triggers on file upload to resize images.  
- **Seamless File Replacement**: The resized image replaces the original in the S3 bucket.  
- **Cost-Effective & Scalable**: Utilizes AWS serverless architecture for minimal operational cost.  
- **Integration Ready**: Can be used with web and mobile apps for optimized media handling.  

## üõ† Tech Stack  
- **AWS Services**: S3, Lambda, IAM, CloudWatch.  
- **Programming Language**: Python (with Pillow library for image processing).  

## üìú Project Workflow  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Setup and Configuration**  
- Created an **S3 bucket** to store images.  
- Configured **S3 event notifications** to trigger Lambda on file upload.  
- Set up **IAM roles and permissions** for secure access between Lambda and S3.  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Lambda Function Development**  
- Developed a **Python-based AWS Lambda function** to handle image resizing.  
- Used **Pillow (PIL)** library for efficient image processing.  
- Defined **pre-configured dimensions** for resizing (e.g., 1024x1024, 800x800).  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment & Testing**  
- Uploaded test images to the S3 bucket to trigger the **Lambda function**.  
- Verified the **resized image replaces the original** in the bucket.  
- Used **CloudWatch logs** for debugging and monitoring execution.  

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Optimization & Enhancements**  
- Implemented **error handling** for unsupported file types.  
- Optimized Lambda execution time for faster processing.  
- Configured **S3 lifecycle policies** for storage cost management.  

## üöß Challenges and Solutions  

| Challenge | Solution |  
|-----------|----------|  
| Handling large image uploads | Optimized memory allocation and Lambda execution time. |  
| Ensuring file format compatibility | Implemented file type validation before processing. |  
| Managing permissions between S3 and Lambda | Defined a strict IAM policy with minimal required permissions. |  

## üéØ Learnings and Impact  
- Gained hands-on experience in **AWS Lambda event-driven processing**.  
- Learned **image optimization techniques** for cloud storage.  
- Built a **scalable, serverless image processing pipeline** with AWS services.
