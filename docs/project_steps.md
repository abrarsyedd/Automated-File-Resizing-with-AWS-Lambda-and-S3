# Project Steps: Automated File Resizing with AWS Lambda & S3  

## üöÄ Project Overview  
A fully serverless solution to automatically resize files upon upload to an S3 bucket using AWS Lambda. This ensures optimized storage, faster processing times, and seamless file handling for various applications.  

## üåü Key Features of the Project  
- **Automatic File Resizing**: Lambda function triggers on file upload to resize files.  
- **Seamless File Replacement**: The resized file replaces the original in the S3 bucket.  
- **Cost-Effective & Scalable**: Utilizes AWS serverless architecture for minimal operational cost.  
- **Integration Ready**: Can be used with web and mobile apps for optimized file management.  

## üõ† Tech Stack  
- **AWS Services**: S3, Lambda, IAM, CloudWatch.  
- **Programming Language**: Python (with appropriate libraries for file processing).  

## üìú Project Workflow  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Setup and Configuration**  
- Created an **S3 bucket** to store files.  
- Configured **S3 event notifications** to trigger Lambda on file upload.  
- Set up **IAM roles and permissions** for secure access between Lambda and S3.  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Lambda Function Development**  
- Developed a **Python-based AWS Lambda function** to handle file resizing.  
- Used **relevant file processing libraries** for efficient handling.  
- Defined **pre-configured parameters** for resizing based on use case.  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment & Testing**  
- Uploaded test files to the S3 bucket to trigger the **Lambda function**.  
- Verified the **resized file replaces the original** in the bucket.  
- Used **CloudWatch logs** for debugging and monitoring execution.  

## üöß Challenges and Solutions  

| Challenge | Solution |  
|-----------|----------|  
| Handling large file uploads | Optimized memory allocation and Lambda execution time. |  
| Ensuring file format compatibility | Implemented file type validation before processing. |  
| Managing permissions between S3 and Lambda | Defined a strict IAM policy with minimal required permissions. |  

## üéØ Learnings and Impact  
- Gained hands-on experience in **AWS Lambda event-driven processing**.  
- Learned **file optimization techniques** for cloud storage.  
- Built a **scalable, serverless file processing pipeline** with AWS services.
